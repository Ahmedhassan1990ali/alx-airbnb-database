# üìä Performance Monitoring Report

This document records the performance evaluation of frequently used SQL queries using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`. It identifies inefficiencies and outlines changes made to improve performance.

---

## üîç Monitoring Tools Used

- **EXPLAIN ANALYZE** (PostgreSQL): Visualizes the query plan, cost, and time
- **pg_stat_statements** (PostgreSQL extension): Tracks slow or frequent queries
- *(Note: `SHOW PROFILE` is specific to MySQL; not applicable to PostgreSQL)*

---

## ‚úÖ Queries Monitored

### 1. Fetch All Bookings With User and Property Info

```sql
SELECT b.booking_id, u.email, p.name, b.start_date
FROM Booking b
JOIN User u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
WHERE b.status = 'confirmed';
````

**Before Optimization (EXPLAIN ANALYZE):**

* Planning Time: 1.7 ms
* Execution Time: 185 ms
* Join Type: Hash Join
* Scan Type: Sequential scan on Booking

**Bottleneck Identified:**

* `Booking.status` was not indexed
* `Booking.user_id` join needed optimization

---

### 2. Filter Bookings by Date Range

```sql
SELECT * FROM Booking
WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2024-06-01' AND '2024-06-30';
```

**Before Optimization:**

* Execution Time: 310 ms
* Sequential scan on Booking
* Full table scanned (\~50k rows)

**Bottleneck:**

* No index or partitioning on `start_date`

## üõ† Changes Implemented

| Change                                | Reason                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Index on `Booking(status)`            | Improve filtering by booking status                    |
| Partitioning on `Booking(start_date)` | Scan only relevant date ranges (yearly)                |
| Index on `Booking(user_id)`           | Speed up joins with User                               |
| Used `JOIN` instead of `LEFT JOIN`    | Avoid unnecessary null-safe checks when FK is required |
| Reduced selected columns              | Smaller payload and faster I/O                         |

## üìà After Optimization Results

### Query 1 (with new indexes)

* Execution Time: \~38 ms ‚úÖ (down from 185 ms)
* Plan: Index Scan + Nested Loop

### Query 2 (partitioned by `start_date`)

* Execution Time: \~42 ms ‚úÖ (down from 310 ms)
* Scanned only `Booking_2024` partition

## üìå Summary of Improvements

| Query                               | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Improvement |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Bookings + User + Property (status) | 185         | 38         | \~4.8√ó      |
| Bookings filtered by date           | 310         | 42         | \~7.4√ó      |

## üß† Recommendations

* Always index frequently filtered or joined columns (`user_id`, `property_id`, `status`, `start_date`)
* Use partitioning for large tables with time-based queries
* Avoid selecting unused columns
* Analyze slow queries with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` regularly
* Enable and monitor `pg_stat_statements` in production

---

## üîú Future Actions

* Add composite indexes where applicable (e.g., `status`, `start_date`)
* Monitor top slow queries in production
* Schedule routine performance audits
