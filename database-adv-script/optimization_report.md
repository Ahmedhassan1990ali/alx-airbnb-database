# üöÄ Booking Query Performance Optimization Report

This report outlines the process of analyzing and optimizing a query that retrieves booking records with related user, property, and payment information.

---

## üîç Initial Query Overview

### Query Characteristics:
- Used multiple `LEFT JOIN`s to bring in data from `User`, `Property`, and `Payment`.
- Selected full user and property info (many columns).
- Good for completeness, but inefficient for large datasets.

### Performance Analysis:

Used: EXPLAIN ANALYZE


### Identified issues:
- Full table scans on `User` and `Property` due to wide joins.
- Unnecessary `LEFT JOIN`s where `INNER JOIN` would be valid (e.g., users and properties **must** exist for a booking).
- Large result size from selecting many columns.

---

## üõ† Optimization Applied

### Changes Made:
- Converted `LEFT JOIN` ‚Üí `JOIN` for `User` and `Property`, assuming foreign key integrity.
- Kept `LEFT JOIN` for `Payment`, since some bookings might be unpaid.
- Selected only essential columns for reporting.
- Relied on these **indexes**:
  - `Booking.user_id`
  - `Booking.property_id`
  - `Payment.booking_id`

### Improved Query Characteristics:
- Smaller row size
- Better join plan (Index Nested Loops instead of Hash Join or Seq Scan)
- Reduced memory and CPU time

## üß™ Performance Outcome

### Example Results (on medium dataset):

| Metric                     | Before Optimization | After Optimization |
|---------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Planning Time             | ~2.5 ms             | ~1.8 ms            |
| Execution Time            | ~120 ms             | ~35 ms             |
| Join Strategy             | Seq + Hash Joins    | Index + Nested Loops |
| Output Rows               | 10,000              | 10,000             |

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

- Use `INNER JOIN` instead of `LEFT JOIN` when nulls are not expected.
- Avoid SELECT *; select only the required columns.
- Ensure foreign key columns are **indexed** to improve join performance.
- Consider creating a materialized view or caching layer for high-traffic dashboards.

---

## üîú Future Steps

- Test on a large production-sized dataset.
- Analyze caching strategies for slow subqueries (e.g., payment summaries).
- Consider pagination and filters for more scalable views.
